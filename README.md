# Admin Dashboard

This is a front-end web application built using React, SCSS, and JavaScript that provides a user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The app allows administrators to manage data effortlessly, with features to add new entries, view existing records, edit details, and delete unwanted items. The clean and responsive UI is styled using SCSS for better maintainability and design flexibility. With React's component-based architecture, the app ensures a seamless and dynamic experience for users interacting with the admin panel.
